# Zips Racing Electric - Dashboard 2023 Code
This is a copy of the code being developed for the dashboard of the 2023 vehicle, this is updated to be in sync with the gitlab repo used for the actual project, but will not reflect commits or issues properly. Please note that this code is in development and currently is not at operational functionality.
## General Overview
The dashboard relies on the usage of specific hardware that is not available for demonstration, and therefore this will be emulated via keyboard input.
- Key '1' - Initialization Drive State
- Key '2' - Low Voltage, Drive Mode disabled
- Key '3' - High Voltage, Drive Mode disabled
- Key '4' - High Voltage, Drive Mode enabled
- Cursor input is used to emulate the touchscreen input of the final dashboard.
